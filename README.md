# game-over


• Developed a Single Page Application (SPA) using React JS called Game Over which displays video games playable on both web browsers and
Windows.

• Implemented user authentication features such as login, logout, and registration processes to ensure secure access to the application, and
implemented user input validation using the Joi library.

• Utilized Context API to manage the app's state globally, allowing for efficient and effective data management.

• Managed to control some complex state updates that depend on each others using the useReducer hook.

• Developed CSS code for the entire application, except for the loading screen, using imperative programming techniques resulting in a
visually engaging and responsive layout.

• Integrated React Router library to enable routing functionality in the application and provided protected routes to ensure authorized access
to the app content.
